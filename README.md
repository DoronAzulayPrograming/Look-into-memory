# Look-into-memory

## Inspiration
The inspiration came from the CE and Reclass softwares.
These softwares are really complex and it interests me if I can even learn how to do it.
Today after half a year I share with you the first version of Lim Engine (currently SmScanner)

#### System Requirements

+ x64 Windows 10;
+ Administrative privilege is required.

## Smdkd - Kernel Driver
The driver is unsigned and unapproved is Your responsibility. !!
To use the driver you need to either install manually or download and use KDU to load it into memory
